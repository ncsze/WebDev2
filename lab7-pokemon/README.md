## React-Redux Pokemon "Catching" Application

The goal of this project was to use React-Redux to allow users to view information from the Poke-API and then "catch" the pokemon up to a group of 6 to a local profile.
This project pulls data from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) and displays it to the user in a React SPA client, using Redux to store a client-side.

## To Run this

`npm install` on the root dir for the server
`npm start` to start the server
`cd client`
`npm install` to install the client
`npm start` to start the client

Routes will be available on http://localhost:3000.
