This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was based on the following repository: https://github.com/stevens-cs546-cs554/CS-554/tree/new-tv-maze-functions/react_second_lecture/tv-maze-function-components
The objective was to add pagination to the client, which pulls from the TVMaze API using axios, and then update the API calls within accordingly to allow all pages to be accessed from the client.
