This is the work I did over the course of the Stevens Institute of Technology course CS554- Web Development II, under Patrick Hill.

The coursework all worked with Node.js and various npm packages, primarily using Express for server routing and middleware, and React for client-side rendering.
Additional technologies and packages used include React-Redux, Bootstrap, Redis, Axios, Apollo, and GraphQL.
