## Express API

This project uses Express and MongoDB to create a REST API for an example of a blog database.
Users can sign up, log in, post blogs or comments on blogs, delete their comments, update or delete blogs, and log out.
The app returns only JSON output: it will be likely easier to see its function using something such as Postman API client.

## To Run this

Install MongoDB locally and run the Mongo server in the background

`npm install` on the root dir for the server
`npm start` to start the server

Routes will be available at http://localhost:3000.
