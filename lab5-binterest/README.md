## GraphQL Using Apollo Server, Apollo Client and React

This is just a simple example of using GraphQL with Apollo server and a client done with Apollo Client and React.
This demo application is "Binterest", where users can see curated image links and "bin" or "unbin" them.
The app uses Unsplash's API -- If you're interested in using Unsplash, make sure to register your own API keys.

## To Run this
`npm install` on the root dir for the server
`npm start` to start the server
`cd client`
`npm install` to install the client
`npm start` to start the client

Routes will be available on http://localhost:3000.
